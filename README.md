# The qss.student package

qss.student allows students to unpack and complete problem sets from 

> K. Imai (2016) *Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction*. Princeton 
> University Press.

or one of the supplementary sets available from the author.

## Installation

The problem sets are a bit too big for CRAN, so you'll want to make sure you've got
the `devtools` package installed and then grab the package from GitHub. 
Like this:

    devtools::install_github("conjugateprior/qss.student")
  
## Notes 

* This package contains all the questions, all the data, but none of the 
  answers!
* It is a *complement* to the [`qss` package](https://kosukeimai.github.io/qss-package).
  That package contains the code from the book chapters. This one has the 
  problems that appear after each chapter.
