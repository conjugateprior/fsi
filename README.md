or one of the supplementary problem sets available from the author.

Note: This package contains all the questions, all the data, but none of the

## Installation

The problem sets are a bit too big for CRAN, so you'll want to make sure you've got
the `devtools` package installed and then grab the package from GitHub. 
Like this:

    devtools::install_github("conjugateprior/qss.student")
